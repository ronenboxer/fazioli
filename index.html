                <h1 class="fw-light">PROFILE</h1>
                <hr>
                <p class="fw-lighter">Fazioli Pianos has been producing grand and concert grand pianos since 1981, when
                    the company was founded by the engineer and pianist Paolo Fazioli. Passion for music, great
                    artisanship, continuous technological research and strict material selection: these are the elements
                    required for building a Fazioli piano. FAZIOLI refuses any industrial approach to manufacturing and
                    pursues the objective of uncompromised quality. The factory is located in Sacile, in the Province of
                    Pordenone (60 km Northeast of Venice) in an area boasting an ancient and prestigious tradition in
                    the art of woodworking.</p>

                <hr>
                <img width="100%;" src="https://www.fazioli.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img-storia.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="fw-lighter">The history of the company is characterised by a growing number of successes: from
                    the first international fairs, to the acquisition of important dealers worldwide, from the sales to
                    the world’s most prestigious theatres to the always closer cooperation with renowned artists who
                    exclusively require Fazioli pianos for their concerts. Among them, we can’t avoid mentioning the
                    great pianist Angela Hewitt and living jazz legend Herbie Hancock.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 class="fw-lighter">PRODUCTION</h2>
                <hr>
                <img width="100%;" src="https://www.fazioli.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img-produzione.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="fw-lighter">Production levels revolve around 140 pianos a year, reaching not only the European
                    and North American market, but also China, Russia, the Far East and South America, as well as
                    various emerging countries. The collection consists of six piano models of different lengths, from
                    the F156 baby grand to the F278 and F308 concert grands. Upon request, any aesthetic modification
                    can be applied to every model (Art Case and Design Collection). The company currently employs a
                    staff of 50 people. The FAZIOLI technicians represent a highly specialized team working with the
                    passion and professionality of someone who is aware of being constantly involved in the construction
                    of a unique and precious object destined to the world of art. The whole production process, from the
                    initial rim bending to the finished product, lasts about two years and requires, as we like to
                    reiterate, technological expertise, great artisanship, rigorous material selection and continuous
                    scientific research. All of these aspects, aiming at reaching uncompromised high quality and
                    therefore much more important than a mere “long-standing tradition”, are associated with an
                    obsessive attention to detail and represent the distinguishing features of our pianos.</p>

                <img width="100%;" src="https://www.fazioli.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img-istituzioni.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="fw-lighter">The success of a company which today is not just considered an authentically “Made
                    in Italy” brand, but a brand in the truest sense of the word, is confirmed by the presence of
                    FAZIOLI pianos at the world’s most important institutions for piano training of the highest level.
                    The famous Juilliard School in New York has recently purchased a FAZIOLI concert grand, thus
                    breaking a monopoly that, to that day, had been bonding the institution to another historic brand.
                    FAZIOLI pianos are also present on the prestigious stages of Teatro La Fenice in Venice and the
                    Palace of Arts in Budapest, the Beijing Grand Theatre and the Colburn School, as well as in the
                    rooms of the Paris Conservatory and the Universities of Vienna, Graz and Salzburg… to cite only a
                    few of the hundreds of institutions owning FAZIOLI pianos worldwide.</p>

                <p class="fw-lighter">Alongside the many competitions that make exclusive use of FAZIOLI pianos, it is
                    worth mentioning the prestigious international competitions offering candidates the possibility of
                    choice among many brands, including FAZIOLI, like the “Chopin” Competition in Warsaw, the
                    “Tchaikovsky” in Moscow, “Honens” in Calgary, “Franz Liszt” in Utrecht. In July 2016, a FAZIOLI
                    concert grand was present at the prestigious Sydney Competition for the first time, gathering
                    resounding success. In May 2017, the company was proud of seeing all finalists of the “Artur
                    Rubinstein Piano Competition” in Tel Aviv performing all rounds on the FAZIOLI piano: first prize
                    went to the 21-year-old Polish Szymon Nehring and second prize to the 25-year-old Rumanian Daniel
                    Petrica Ciobanu, while 28-year-old Yevgeny Yontov was awarded the “Best Israeli Pianist” and “Best
                    Chamber Music Performance” Prizes .</p>

                <p class="fw-lighter">Historically focused on technological, productive and creative aspects – as stated
                    by “The Economist”, a company that 40 years ago didn’t even exist, is considered today to be a great
                    example for its strong commitment to research, innovation and promotion of its product: a piano
                    constantly looking to the future. Every day FAZIOLI sees new challenges as an opportunity for
                    growth: occasions to write another chapter in that history of the piano that the company does not
                    wish to betray, but rather to carry forward with curiosity and intelligence.</p>

                <h1 class="fw-light">MISSION & VISION</h1>
                <hr>
                <p class="fw-lighter">The FAZIOLI factory was born out of a challenge: demonstrating that the piano is
                    not an instrument passively and indissolubly anchored to tradition. On the contrary, the company has
                    always assumed that the piano, like any other work of the human intelligence, can and has to be
                    subject to technological development and aesthetical improvement, without betraying the glorious
                    past that wrote its history. Since the very beginning, FAZIOLI has consistently brought forward its
                    philosophy, which can be summarized in few, however important, points:
                </p>
                <ul class="fw-lighter">
                    <li>producing exclusively grand and concert grand pianos, destined to the professional market;</li>
                    <li>excluding any imitation process and pursuing the idea of a FAZIOLI sound inspired by the Italian
                        “Bel Canto”;</li>
                    <li>individually handcrafting each piano (every FAZIOLI instrument is unique), refusing every
                        industrial process;</li>
                    <li>using only the best materials and cutting-edge manufacturing techniques;</li>
                    <li>constantly carrying on scientific research through an internal “Research and Develoment”
                        department and the collaboration with academic research institutions and external private
                        subjects;</li>
                    <li>meeting the demand of those who wish to acquire a unique and aesthetically fully-customized
                        instrument (Art Case & Home Design collections).</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="fw-lighter"> Almost 40 years later, FAZIOLI strongly believes to have carried out this mission
                    coherently, thus
                    inspiring the whole acoustic piano manufacturing sector.

                <h1 class="fw-light">2. FAZIOLI PIANO ACTION (PATENTED ALL OVER THE WORLD NR. 2924683 OF 18/3/2015)</h1>
                <hr>
                <p class="fw-lighter">The structure of a traditional grand piano action is provided with bar elements
                    made in drawn aluminium filled by wood or a composite material such as multiplex wood or similar.
                    This can be the reason of drawbacks, mainly due to the need for frequent and complicated maintenance
                    operations, above all due to malfunctioning or breakings, connected for example to the moisture
                    absorbed from solid wood of the bars (when they are made of wood) or, due to unsatisfactory
                    resonances, caused by a single body in metal or composite material.
                    The new FAZIOLI patented action aims to be less sensitive with respect to humidity.
                    A further positive aspect is that the keys are provided with greater smoothness and able to
                    consistently detect the skill of the pianist by generating an optimal sound and a better timbre.
                    In the new FAZIOLI action, the structure comprises a hollow section preferably made of aluminium,
                    having at the inside a full structure, preferably a multilayer in wood or in such natural material.
                    The three action bars (Hammer flange rail, Wippen flange rail, Let-off rail) are filled inside with
                    particularly resistant multi-layers wood to avoid wear of the threads of the screws when these are
                    removed for mechanical adjustment work.
                    The rails are screwed into the special housings obtained on the action brackets, creating a perfect
                    mechanical coupling.
                    The result is a particularly rigid structure that does not dissipate energy.
                    A big advantage is that the rails can be disassembled or replaced if necessary.
                    All fastenings and materials have been subjected to extreme laboratory tests for mechanical stress
                    and resistance to climate change.

                <p class="fw-lighter">The characteristics of the strings (length, diameter, tension, density and
                    flexibility of materials) and their distribution are designed to minimize acoustic non-uniformities
                    between notes that are near to each other. It allows natural flow from the clear depth of bass notes
                    to sweet, sustained singing mid-tones, and through to the gleaming brightness of the highest notes.
                    Fazioli models actively contribute to the quality of the final sound via the possibility of
                    adjustment, note by note, of both front and rear duplex scales.
                    This precise adjustment undoubtedly increases the range of colour available to the highly trained
                    ear.

                <h1 class="fw-light">4. DUPLEX SCALE</h1>
                <hr>
                <p class="fw-lighter">The duplex scale concerns the first two sectors of the piano.
                    On the Fazioli pianos, both the positions of the two capo d’astro in the two first sectors and the
                    not-speaking string portions (rear scale) are adjustable.
                    The capo d’astro are made of bronze, have a triangular section and their basis are carefully
                    rectified. Also, the basement of the cast-iron frame front bars (against which the capo d’astro is
                    set), are carefully rectified and adjusted.
                    Since the two contact surfaces are both perfectly rectified, the result is a perfect coupling.
                    In this way, the capo d’astro can slide on the bases of the bars to reach the position that
                    guarantees the string to have the correct speaking length between the bridge and the capo d’astro.
                    The string lengths included between the bridge and the chromed brass triangles are called resonators
                    or rear scale. The triangles are located under the strings, before the hitch pins, and can be
                    adjusted with a special tool, slightly sliding them on the inox-stainless steel plate on which they
                    are placed.
                    In this way, the resonators reach the optimal tuning in relation to their main vibrating portions
                    and, during the performance, are now able to vibrate sympathetically with the main speaking length
                    of the string, enriching the piano sound.

                <hr>
                <p class="fw-lighter">The cast-iron frame is the component responsible for absorbing the compression
                    exerted by the tension of the strings.
                    It is made with a sand-casting process.
                    Very tight tolerances are required of the caster with regard to flatness and weight.
                    As with the wooden components, a stabilization period is also required for the cast iron frame.
                    In fact, due to the different cooling of the parts, due to different volumes of cast iron from area
                    to area, the frames maintain internal tensions.
                    To ensure that these tensions are redistributed, the cast iron frame should be left to rest for at
                    least the first six / eight months of life, before being used.

                    <li>Greater mobility of the soundboard with a significant increase in dynamic range, colour and

                <h1 class="fw-light">7. PRECISE SOUNDBOARD DESIGN AND NEWLY PATENTED FAZIOLI SOUNDBOARD</h1>
                <hr>
                <img width="100%;" src="https://www.fazioli.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img-parte-05.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="fw-lighter">The ultimate goal of a piano soundboard is to maintain the full richness of the
                    vibrations generated by the strings, gradually converting them into sound waves which are propagated
                    efficiently through the surrounding air.
                    The soundboard is a very complex component that represents the heart of the piano.
                    It is formed of planks 11 mm thick and with a width varying between 8 and 12 cm. These are glued
                    edge to edge forming a thin membrane, stiff and light at the same time.
                    Ribs are glued to the underside perpendicularly to the grain of the soundboard, giving them greater
                    uniformity and a slight upward curvature.Then, the mid-upper and bass bridges are glued on the
                    opposite side of the ribs. The two bridges transfer the vibrations from the strings to the
                    soundboard. The soundboard must react uniformly to the vibrations of the strings, absorbing energy
                    and converting it into air vibration.
                    Fazioli has dedicated a significant portion of its research to optimizing the soundboard, also
                    patenting innovative solutions for its creation.
                    It is built with the best spruce of the Italian Eastern Alps (including Val di Fiemme).
                    The positioning of the ribs, their dimensions, the tapering at their ends and the relative length
                    are the result of an infinite number of tests that have led to today’s results.
                    The same applies to the method of gluing the bridges, to the tapering process and optimizing the
                    soundboard curvature.
                    The optimization of all the above parameters will henceforth be entrusted to the mathematical model
                    recently developed by the R&D department, which is able to simulate the behavior of the soundboard
                    according to different configurations.
                </p>
                <p class="fw-lighter">
                    <span class="fw-light">The newly patented FAZIOLI soundboard</span> consists in three wood layers
                    with the following structure:
                    Two layers of red spruce are superimposed with the grain in the same direction. In the middle,
                    between them, it’s glued a spruce veneer (0,6 mm thick) which grain is perpendicular (90 degrees) to
                    the grain of the outer layers.
                    The three layers structure does not affect the sound but makes the soundboard itself much more
                    resistant to potential cracks or swellings. As a consequence, it provides a particularly suitable
                    solution in case of extreme humid or dry climates. However, the innovation is appropriate to every
                    circumstance to guarantee maximum efficiency to the instrument over the years.

                <p class="fw-lighter">
                    The rims are made with special presses that glue a 6 mm pack of solid wood sheets of the best
                    Canadian maple and African mahogany, initially straight, shaping it with special clamps around the
                    relative mould.
                    Thicknesses of 6 mm are used which make the bending process more laborious and expensive but, in the
                    end, we will have rims with fewer lines of glue.
                    The preponderance of wood in the rims will give a positive participation in the formation of sound.
                    Many manufacturers use 2/3 mm veneer to speed up the process, but the result will not be the same.
                    For gluing, a special thermo-hardening glue is used, very hard and almost glassy, capable of
                    withstanding high levels of humidity.
                    In this way we will get a band that will be a real wooden monolith.

                    soundboard.
                    Instrument design must aim to maintain the musical vibrations within the limits of these two
                    systems. As long as vibration energy bounces back and forth between the strings and the soundboard,
                    the sound can spread and endure. If this energy flows out beyond the limits of the soundboard and
                    propagates through the rims, fundamentally it is lost.
                    In fact, the mass and rigidity of the case are such that it has very limited mobility: exactly the
                    opposite of what is desirable in the soundboard.
                    Ideally, the bonding of soundboard and rims should impede any transfer of vibrations from one to the
                    other. Fazioli research aims to maximize this acoustic isolation, employing constantly evolving
                    build techniques, involving not only soundboard and case but also the cast-iron frame and all other
                    acoustically passive instrument components.

                    Fazioli pianos are continually perfected down to the most minute details also in terms of elements
                    not directly linked to the production of sound, but intrinsically connected to the quality of the
                    final product.
                    The general design of the instrument while respecting the shape of the classic grand piano has been
                    re-proportioned, all the edges (for example) have been removed. The hinges and all the visible
                    accessories, which are commonly made of brass, in our case are gilded in a 24-carat galvanic bath.
                    This gilding process will avoid oxidation of the brass, letting the surfaces be bright and intact
                    for a very long time.
                    Every screw, joint, bond and other construction detail is carefully analysed to identify potential
                    improvements. There is always room to improve, on a range of fronts: sourcing of materials and
                    components, glues and paints, processing, build and assembly, packaging, final inspection, testing
                    and sign-off, transport and shipping, and the musical use of the piano itself.
                    This is a journey towards perfection that involves everything and everyone, working together. And it
                    is a journey that we will always be dedicated to.

                <p class="fw-lighter">Wood is a natural, living material, which reacts to the changes in temperature and
                    humidity of the surrounding environment. Since the piano mainly consists of wood, it is preferable
                    to place it in rooms where temperature and humidity levels do not fluctuate too drastically. If
                    relative humidity is higher than suggested levels (as is the case in humid regions, especially
                    during transitions between seasons and the summer months), we recommend using a common dehumidifier
                    which is easily available. Humidity levels should never be lower than 30% or higher than 70%.
                    If relative humidity is too low, as is the case in heated rooms during the winter months, we
                    recommend using a common humidifier, again easily available on the market. The piano should never be
                    left in a dry room. We suggest positioning your piano far from windows and external walls. In order
                    to avoid damage to the instrument, we suggest that you should not keep the piano under direct
                    sunlight. We also suggest that you do not place any objects on the piano as this may cause
                    vibrations. Please note that should any liquid fall on the piano you might risk serious damage.

                <p class="fw-lighter">Purchasing a piano represents a long-term investment; maintaining it in optimal
                    conditions is of paramount importance for helping maintain the value of your instrument over time.
                    The lifespan of your piano greatly depends on the quality of its maintenance. Routine maintenance
                    should only be entrusted to an officially certified technician.
                    There are three determining factors influencing the acoustics and functional qualities of a piano:

                <p class="fw-lighter">The human hear can adjust so easily to different sound conditions, that it is
                    often difficult to understand when an instrument is “out of tune”. The tuning of a piano varies
                    according to a gradual process to which our ears become accustomed. Human hearing is unable to
                    perceive slight frequency alterations, especially if these changes occur in all registers. If the
                    tuning is not carried out regularly, the education of the ear can be heavily affected, just as the
                    conditions of the instrument itself. The tuning frequency varies according to the usage made of the
                    instrument, both in terms of time and intensity. In any case, it is always advisable to call one’s
                    own trusted technician no less than twice a year.

                <p class="fw-lighter">The characteristics of the strings (length, diameter, tension, density and
                    flexibility of materials) and their distribution are designed to minimize acoustic non-uniformities
                    between notes that are near to each other. It allows natural flow from the clear depth of bass notes
                    to sweet, sustained singing mid-tones, and through to the gleaming brightness of the highest notes.
                    Fazioli models actively contribute to the quality of the final sound via the possibility of
                    adjustment, note by note, of both front and rear duplex scales.
                    This precise adjustment undoubtedly increases the range of colour available to the highly trained
                    ear.

                <p class="fw-lighter">As you do not play each note the same number of times, the keyboard and action are
                    subject to uneven wear, which brings about slight alterations in the response of the action itself.
                    Maintaining a well-regulated action is essential to preserving a fine touch and tone. Well-regulated
                    actions and keyboards are essential for the reliability of the performance. You should therefore ask
                    your technician to carry out an action regulation at least once a year, as to rebalance these normal
                    slight response alterations of the keyboard.

                <p class="fw-lighter">It’s the technique used by the technician to vary the density of the felt on the
                    hammerhead, which greatly affects the tone quality of the piano, by means of a three-needled tool.
                    In fact, the hammerheads tend to harden unevenly because of normal wear and climate variations. A
                    suitably qualified technician will re-establish the evenness and beauty of tone by pricking the
                    surface of the felt. For the above-mentioned reasons, even if your piano is rarely played, we
                    recommend the following:

                <p class="fw-lighter">The various piano components can be finished and treated in different ways. As a
                    consequence, the care of these surfaces is diversified and must be carried out with the utmost
                    attention. To clean matt surfaces, we recommend using a slightly moistened soft cloth with
                    non-abrasive detergent (without any kind of solvent) applied with slight pressure in clockwise
                    motion. To clean high-gloss surfaces, we recommend dusting them using a slightly moistened soft
                    cloth with non-abrasive detergent. Do not under any circumstances use any type of abrasive
                    detergent. Metal parts need maintenance as well. The hinges and screws are plated with 24K-gold and
                    tend to develop a dust film, which can be removed with a slightly moistened soft cloth moistened
                    with non-abrasive detergent. In order to remove oxidation from the brass Fazioli logo and pedals, we
                    suggest using common non-abrasive deoxidizing creams, which can be easily found on the market (Sidol
                    or similar products). To clean the keyboard, we recommend using a slightly moistened soft cloth with
                    non-abrasive detergent. It is important to avoid moistening the sides of the keys.

                <hr>
                <p class="fw-lighter">Fazioli refuses to impose limitations on Artists, convinced that they should have
                    the freedom to choose on which instrument to play, based purely on the belief that it represents the
                    best vehicle to express their talent. For this reason, Fazioli has always been opposed to signing
                    exclusivity contracts with pianists, preferring instead the establishment of reciprocal partnerships
                    for the sake of the pure artistic purpose, which should always take precedence over commercial
                    considerations.</p>

                <h1 class="fw-light">FAZIOLI CONCERT HALL</h1>
                <hr>
                <p class="fw-lighter">The FAZIOLI CONCERT HALL mirrors the image of a company devoted not only to the
                    promotion of its own product, but also of the world of art and culture, for which FAZIOLI pianos are
                    made.
                    The hall, which has been standing next to the FAZIOLI factory since 2004, has 198 seats and 40
                    additional seats.
                    Its stage can accommodate musical ensembles right up to the chamber orchestra and it has been
                    designed
                    to ensure the finest acoustic properties.
                    Indeed, thanks to a series of movable devices – wooden “eyelashes”, wooden panels and
                    sound-absorbing
                    materials -, it is possible to modify the reverberation time of the hall and, consequently,
                    influence
                    the characteristics of the sound environment, obtaining more resonance or more absorption. By virtue
                    of
                    this versatility, the hall lends itself to hosting selections and piano testing – with particular
                    regard
                    to those destined to the largest concert halls, concerts and recordings.

                <p class="fw-lighter">The Fazioli Concert Hall season, launched in 2005, has now reached its 13th
                    edition:
                    an important milestone that highlights the continuous and privileged contact of the FAZIOLI Company
                    with
                    the most renowned artists of the international concert scene, as well as the promotion of young
                    artists
                    – a dear aspect for FAZIOLI. Indeed, specifically for the pianists of the new generation FAZIOLI has
                    conceived the new “Winners” concert series, dedicated to the winners of the most renowned piano
                    competitions.
                    All concerts are open to the public and the season draws a national as well as international
                    audience,
                    with a major positive impact on the local cultural development.

                <p class="fw-lighter">Recording at the Fazioli Concert Hall is the ideal solution for those looking for
                    a
                    unique environment offering the answer to the most diverse needs:
                </p>
                <ul class="fw-light">
                    <li>variable acoustics;</li>
                    <li>a high-level piano;</li>
                    <li>a piano tuner at their full disposal; </li>
                    <li>a quiet and professional working environment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="fw-lighter">It is foreseen that the artists should work with their trusted sound engineers.
                    Indeed, out of a precise choice, the hall is not equipped with microphones and mixers, since we
                    preferred to create the conditions allowing external sound engineers to install their own equipment
                    in
                    the dedicated control room.
                    To those who wish it, our offices can suggest sound engineers of proven reputation and experience,
                    with
                    whom artists (or their producers) are asked to maintain direct relations, both in economic and
                    organizational terms.
